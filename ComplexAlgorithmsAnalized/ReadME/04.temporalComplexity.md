## temporal complexity

Time complexity is the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute. In other words, how the algorithm grows over time, relative to the number of input elements it must process.

Algorithm Comparison
Let's compare two algorithms that solve the same problem: “Astronaut” and “Expert”. The first algorithm increases its execution time as more students are entered. The execution time of the second remains constant.

Although both algorithms solve the same problem, they handle their execution times differently as it processes more elements.

Example of execution times for two different algorithms
The following graph shows the execution time depending on the number of elements to process (inputs).

The “Astronaut” algorithm has a linear trend, that is, the more elements it executes, the more time the program will need.

The "Expert" algorithm is constant, that is, it executes the application at the same time for any value of elements to be processed.

Graphic representation of two examples of algorithms
Therefore, complexity is not about how many seconds, approximately, an algorithm takes to execute, but how the time increases when there are more or fewer elements to process.
