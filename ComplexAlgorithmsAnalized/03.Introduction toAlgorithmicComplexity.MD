## Algorithmic complexity 

Algorithmic complexity consists of understanding the growth of resources that an algorithm requires when executing a certain number of elements.

In other words, the algorithm may behave in a way with 10, 15 or 20 elements. However, with hundreds or thousands of items, the algorithm will likely behave differently, with respect to time and space.

The resources to measure the complexity of an algorithm are time and space:

Time is represented in milliseconds, seconds, minutes, etc.

Space is represented in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, etc.

complexity theory
Complexity theory studies the consumption of resources (time/space) that an algorithm occupies.

Algorithmic complexity does not refer to the execution time of the algorithm (seconds, minutes, hours, etc.), but to the pace and how efficient an algorithm can be, based on the problem it is solving.

Through complexity we seek to understand the growth of resources, not their size. It is the growth of resources that matters.
